# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of three beginner-friendly machine learning projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction, and Iris Flower Classification. These projects aim to explore different aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling techniques.

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Project Description
The Titanic dataset is used to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic classification problem often recommended for beginners in data science and machine learning.

### Dataset
The dataset typically includes information about passengers such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Fare
- Cabin
- Whether the passenger survived or not (target variable)

### Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset.
- Explore correlations between features and survival.
- Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict survival based on passenger attributes.

### Techniques
- Feature engineering (handling missing data, encoding categorical variables).
- Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).

## 2. Movie Rating Prediction

### Project Description
In this project, the goal is to predict the rating of a movie based on its features such as genre, director, and actors. This task involves regression techniques to estimate the numerical ratings.

### Dataset
The dataset typically contains the following features:
- Genre
- Director
- Cast (e.g., lead actors)
- Budget
- Year of release
- User or critic ratings (target variable)

### Objectives
- Perform data analysis and preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical data, handling missing values).
- Develop regression models to predict movie ratings.
- Understand the factors that influence a movie's rating.

### Techniques
- Data analysis and visualization.
- Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

## 3. Iris Flower Classification

### Project Description
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, consisting of measurements of three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The objective is to classify flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (target variable)

### Objectives
- Train a model using the Iris dataset to classify flowers into one of the three species.
- Understand and evaluate the performance of the model.

### Techniques
- Data visualization to explore the dataset.
- Classification models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors).
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
